% 3) following parameterization orients base onto the defintions of paper (i,ii)

        gamma       = 2*pi*42.577*10^6; 
        E1          = exp(-TR./T1);
        E2          = exp(-TR./T2);
        % note: For the "phi" defintion additional constant phase terms are given in paper (i), 
        % while this leads only to a global phase shift and hence they are all set
        % to zero for this simulation. 
        % tot = tot.*exp(-1i.*angle(mean(tot))) is performed in the main code to
        % correct for this arbitrariness anyway
        phi         = gamma*(dB0+deltaCS*B0)*TE;
        theta0      = gamma*(dB0+deltaCS*B0)*TR;
        % note: The sampling of phiPC in paper(i) starts at 180°, while other paper
        % start at 0° which is however not affecting the resulting profile shapes
        theta       = theta0-phiPC; 
        % note the negative sign of phiPC which follows "left handedness convention"
        % it does not affect the shape as discussed in theory section of the Note but
        % the rotation sense of the profile in complex plane is clockwise
        % instead to [Zur,Ganter]. This is not a problem and only mentioned
        % for completeness. For plausibility the sign of phiPC can be inverted which will
        % lead to equal trajectories.
        denominator = 1-E1.*cos(alpha)-E2.^2.*(E1-cos(alpha));  % auxiliary defintion
        M           = M0.*(1-E1).*sin(alpha)./denominator; 
        K           = 1;                                        % "K is the magnitude of the combined receive field" (i)
                                                                % -> extensive global magnitude scales do not change shape
                                                                % of the profile and hence K=1 is chosen for this function
        Meff        = K.*M.*exp(-TE/T2);
        b           = E2.*(1-E1).*(1+cos(alpha))./denominator;
        a           = E2; 
 
        % Note: the first exponent theta0 has the same sign to the second exponent phi=theta0*TE/TR 
        % i.e. ~(1-E2*exp(1i*(theta0-phiPC)))*exp(1i*theta0*TE/TR) is
        % PLUS/PLUS in contrast to the opposite sign function
        % The sign of phiPC is negative in contrast to the opposite sign function
        % This does not lead to different shapes of the trajectory as can be checked
        % by an inversion of the phiPC sign
